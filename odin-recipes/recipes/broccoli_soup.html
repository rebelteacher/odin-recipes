        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>4 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>

Add reserved water and chicken bouillon granules, and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium; simmer, stirring constantly until thickened.</p>

<p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
<p>Stir in milk, nutmeg, pepper, and processed and chopped broccoli, and heat through. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve garnished with grated cheddar cheese.</p>
